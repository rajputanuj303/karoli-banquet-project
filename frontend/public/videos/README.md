# Video Assets

This folder should contain video files for the website.

## Required Videos:
- `Banquet.mp4` - Main hero section background video (should be optimized and under 100MB)

## Note:
Due to GitHub file size limitations, large video files (>100MB) are not included in the repository.
Please add your video files to this directory for local development.

## Recommendations:
- Use compressed video formats (H.264/H.265)
- Optimize videos for web (reduce quality/resolution if needed)
- Consider using video hosting services for production (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
